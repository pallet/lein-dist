# lein-dist

Package a [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) project into a
self contained tar file, containing all the project's dependencies.

Requires leiningen version 2.

## Usage

    $ lein dist

Creates `myproject-version.tar` in the `target` directory.

## Install

Add `[lein-dist "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` to the `:plugins` vector of your `:user`
profile, or your `project.clj`.

## Details

The plugin will create a version of the project that uses a project-local maven
repo using `:local-repo "local-m2"`, resolves all the dependencies into that
repository and then sets `:offline? true`.

The plugin also packages a version of `lein`, that uses `./.lein` as it's
configuration directory (`LEIN_HOME`).
